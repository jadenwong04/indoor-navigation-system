<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
<blockquote>Indoor navigation systems currently implemented at Monash Malaysiaâ€™s campus are static, requiring students to manually enter their location, which is then mapped to the nearest checkpoint that contains a route to their destination.</blockquote>

<h3> The existing solution fails to address the following issues: </h3>

<ol>
  <li> 
    Locating the initial position. 
    <ul> 
      <li> Requiring users to identify their location is a challenge itself. </li>
      <li> Inaccurate position input can result in large margins of error (especially within indoor locations).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking user movements.
    <ul>
      <li> Hassle for users to guess their position while moving along the route. </li>
      <li> High likelihood for users to drift away from route (making the wrong turn, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Our Solution </h2>

<h3> Real Time Indoor Positioning </h3>
<blockquote> Automatic approximation of users position through computations of RSSI signals from nearby IOT devices. </blockquote>

<h3> Shortest Routes to Destination </h3>
<blockquote> Increasing navigation efficiency by dynamically identifying shortest available route from the user's position to destination. </blockquote>

<h3> Orientation Detection </h3>
<blockquote> Provides audio and visual cues that let users know which direction they are facing and the steps they need to take to reach their destination. </blockquote>

<h3> Deviation Handling </h3>
<blockquote> Automatically detects when users make a wrong turn and re-routes to ensure they get back on track. </blockquote>
